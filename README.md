# Learning Vue

This repo is my journey of learning VueJS.
On `master` branch you will not find much other than this README.
However, other branches may hold the various stages of my journey.

### [1-simple-app](https://github.com/razvan-tudosa/vue-todo/tree/1-simple-app)
On this branch you can find the todo app written in a naive manner, nothing fancy is there, just the bare-bones of a typical application, exploring the basics of VueJS. 


## A demo of the latest work can be found [here](https://razvan-tudosa.github.io/vue-todo/).
